Problem

One to many relationship
Consider a person who has multiple mobile numbers, that forms a one to many relationship. One to many relationship comes to play in our application when for one event type there will be many events. A one to one relationship wouldn't be handy for that scenario. Let's implement one to many relationship for a similar scenario that deals with the grouping of events in accordance with the event type.

Write a Java program to create a one to many relationships between two classes.

Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented specifications given in the problem statement. All class names, attribute names and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.

Create an Event class with the following private attributes

Attributes	Datatype
name	String
detail	String
type	String
organiserName	String
 

Create an EventType class with the following private attributes

Attributes	Datatype
name	String
list	ArrayList<Event>
 

Include appropriate getters, setters, default and Parameterised constructor for both classes.

Create  an EventTypeBO class with the following methods

Method	Description
public void display(ArrayList<EventType> list)	This method accepts an ArrayList of EventType objects as an argument.
It prints details of the EventType objects

Create a driver class called Main, obtain input Event details from the input.
Maintain an ArrayList of EventType objects.
In accordance with the eventType input, add the event object to the list(ArrayList attribute of the EventType object) of the corresponding EventType object in the List(ArrayList of EventType objects in driver class).
At last display the eventType name and its corresponding Event details.

Input and Output format:
The first line of input consists of type of events which is in CSV format.
The next line of input represent the number of events n.
The next n lines of input represent the event details in the CSV format.(name,detail,type,organiserName)

Output format:
Use "%-20s%-20s%-20s\n" for formatting Event details.
Refer to sample Input and Output for formatting specifications.

Note: All text in bold corresponds to the input and rest corresponds to the output

Sample Input and Output:

Enter the type of events in CSV format
Academics,Auction
Enter the number of Events
3
Enter the Event 1 Details
Book expo,Special sales,Academics,Mahesh
