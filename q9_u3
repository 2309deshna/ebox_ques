Problem

Overloading makePayment()
 

Consider doing an extra feature for the stage show organisers. Bring up an interactive console application for Billing so that our application looks unique from other competitors. Customers pay using cash, online wallets, and credit card. For each category obtain necessary information from the user. You also require a receipt for all the transactions which should be printed at the end of the transaction. Let's increase our coding proficiency by implement Function overloading for the payments. Hence write a program meeting all the above specification.

Create a class named TicketBooking with the following private attributes.

Attributes	Datatype
stageEvent	String
customer	String
noOfSeats	Integer
 

 

Include getters and setters for the class.
Include default and parameterized constructors.
Format for parameterized constructor is TicketBooking(String stageEvent, String customer, Integer noOfSeats)

The TicketBooking class has the following methods.

 

 

Method Name	Description
public void makePayment(Double amount)	This method is for cash payment.
This method accepts amount as input and
displays the transaction detail
public void makePayment(String walletNumber ,Double amount)	This method is for wallet payment.

displays the transaction detail.
public void makePayment(String creditCard,String ccv,String name,Double amount)	This method is for credit card payment.
This method accepts credit card detail,
ccv, card holder name ,and amount as input and
displays the transaction detail 
 

 
Create a driver class called Main. In the Main method, obtain input from the user in CSV format and call appropriate methods for transactions. If choice other than specified is chosen, print "Invalid choice".
Note: display one digit after decimal point for double values.
Format for TicketBooking Input is stageEvent,customer,noOfSeats
