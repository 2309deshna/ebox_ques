Overriding-simple

Overriding is another concept that every application developer should know. Overriding is a runtime polymorphism. The inherited class has the overridden method which has the same name as the method in the parent class. The argument number, types or return types should not differ in any case. The method is invoked with the object of the specific class ( but  with the reference of the parent class).

Now let's try out a simple overriding concept in our application. For this, we can take our original example of Class Event, and its child classes Exhibition and StageEvent.

Create a parent class Event with following protected attributes,

Attributes	Datatype
name	String
detail	String
ownerName	String

Then create child class Exhibition that extends Event with the following attribute,

Attributes	Datatype
noOfStall	Integer

And create another child class StageEvent that extends Event with the following attribute,

Attributes	Datatype
noOfShows	Integer
noOfSeatsPerShow	Integer

Add suitable constructor (with super() if necessary) and getters/setters for the classes. Add method projectedRevenue() in parent and its child class.

Method	Description
public Double projectedRevenue()	calculate revenue and return the double value. In parent class return just 0.0

Note: For Exhibition, each stall will produce Rs.10000 as revenue. For StageEvent, each seat produces Rs.50 revenue.

Refer sample input/output for other further details and format of the output.
